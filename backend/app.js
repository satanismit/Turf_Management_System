// app.js serves as the main entry point for the Express.js server. 
// It initializes the application, sets up middleware for handling requests 
// (like parsing JSON or enabling CORS), connects to the database, 
// defines API routes (e.g., for login, registration, and turf bookings), 
// and starts the server to listen for incoming requests. 
// This file orchestrates the entire backend, ensuring all components work 
// together to provide the 12-15 APIs you mentioned. It's essential for 
// running the server and managing the application's flow.
