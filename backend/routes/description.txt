Maps API endpoints to specific controller functions, 
defining how the server responds to requests 
like /api/login or /api/book. 
Organizes endpoints by feature 
(e.g., authRoutes.js for authentication). Uses Express.js 
routing to direct incoming requests to the appropriate 
handlers. Simplifies API management and makes the backend
scalable for your 12-15 APIs.
