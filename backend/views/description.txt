Optional folder for rendering dynamic responses, such as HTML 
templates if your backend serves web pages. Uses engines like 
EJS to inject data into templates for user-facing content. In 
API-focused backends like yours, it might be minimal or unused, 
focusing on JSON responses instead. Helps in cases where
the backend needs to generate views for admin dashboards or emails.
